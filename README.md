## Introduction to Data Science
### Linear regression
> Linear regression is a statistical model used to predict the relationship between dependent and independent variable.

> Examine two factors:
  - Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variables?
  - How significant is the Regression line to make predictions with highest possible accuracy?
  
### The simplest form of a simple linear regression equation with one dependent and one independent variable is represented by:
   **y=mx+c**
  - Where,
    **y** ---> Dependent Variable  
          
    **x** ---> Independent Variable
    
    **m** ---> Slope of the line  
    
    **c** ---> Coefficient of the line
  -  **m** = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)
